Visual evidence: three women standing close together; central woman looking directly at camera; composition appears posed. Cross-modal setup: the caption directs the women to perform casualness while the photo itself shows a staged group pose. [Pivot] Mechanism: dominant_affiliation. Trigger rule: the imperative asserts control and presumes the women need instruction, using presumed closeness to command; this is an instance of Talking Down because the speaker positions themselves as the one who can direct the women's presentation. [Inference] Attitude label: Dismissive. The speaker/uploader holds this stance toward the addressed women by issuing a controlling, corrective directive. Domain/Culture provides no additional disambiguation.",False
attitude_7354.png,attitude_7354,you smell coffee? me neither. make some!,speaker (meme voice),the addressee ('you'),Attitude,dominant_detachment,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,NULL,Dismissive,"[Anchor]
Text evidence: ""me neither. make some!"" (negative tone). Visual evidence: grey cat with narrowed eyes; slightly downturned mouth; direct, fixed stare at camera. Cross-modal setup: The blunt imperative is overlaid on a contemptuous feline expression, so image and text together present a commanding voice.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: The wording asserts an objective negation (""me neither"") then issues an imperative, taking the high ground and dismissing the other's sensory claim; the cat's disdainful gaze reinforces this stance — Invalidation. Minimal justification: the text denies the addressee's implication and refuses engagement, while the image amplifies detachment.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Dismissive. The meme-speaker (the 'I' voice/the cat) directs dismissal at the addressee ('you') by rejecting their cue and ordering action. Domain/Culture provides no additional disambiguation.",False

Visual evidence: person holding a microphone on an outdoor stage; pointing gesture; sunglasses; visible musical equipment. Cross-modal setup: The sexualized, provocative caption is superimposed over a neutral performance photo, linking a performative boast to the text. [Pivot] Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: The caption treats a woman's declared orientation as dismissible and proposes adopting a trans identity as a tactic, invalidating the target's stated stance; the performer's confident posture reinforces a high-ground, dismissive stance. Sub-logic used: Invalidation. [Inference] Attitude label: Contemptuous. Subject/target justification: The meme author/speaker expresses contempt toward a woman's declared lesbian identity (and trivializes trans identity) by treating the orientation as overridable. Domain/Culture provides no additional disambiguation.",False

Text evidence: ""immigrant problem problem fixed"" (negative tone). Visual evidence: several people walking along a dirt path; many carry backpacks and plastic bags; dense tall grass/reeds at roadside. Cross-modal setup: the text labels ""immigrant"" as a ""problem"" while the photo shows a group of people moving, linking the demeaning label to those depicted.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the wording asserts moral/intellectual high ground by reducing the group to a ""problem"" and declaring it ""fixed,"" combined with the image of real people; this frames blame as inherent to the group's character (Character Blaming). Minimal justification: labeling plus declarative resolution dismisses the group's legitimacy and denies their personhood.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Contemptuous. The uploader (subject) directs contempt toward immigrants (target) by characterizing them as a problem and announcing its resolution. Domain (public discourse about immigration) amplifies this political/public framing; Culture provides no additional disambiguation.",False

Text evidence: ""true strength comes from within"" (positive). Visual evidence: young child with missing arms seated against a stained bare wall; sparse, dilapidated interior; another child blurred in background. Cross-modal setup: The uplifting maxim is overlaid on an image of a visibly disabled child in a poor setting.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_affiliation. Trigger rule: The warm, general praise framed over the photo treats the child as an object of admiration while implicitly lowering the baseline for 'strength,' creating a superior external stance toward the subject—Patronizing Praise. This arises from wording plus image-text tension.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Dismissive. The speaker (meme creator) expresses a superficially positive stance toward the child that reduces the child's situation to an inspirational trope. Domain/Culture: Online meme culture's tendency toward ""inspiration porn"" supports this patronizing, dismissive interpretation.",False

Visual evidence: woman in white holding an AR-style rifle; other congregants in white seated; interior shows church-like decorations. Cross-modal setup: the caption stereotypes Texas churches while the photo depicts an armed congregant, linking text and image to present firearm presence as typical. [Pivot] Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the caption mockingly generalizes and judges the group, using the image to moralize behavior (Character Blaming); the speaker takes a high-ground, dismissive stance rather than engaging sympathetically. [Inference] Attitude label: Contemptuous. The speaker (captioner) directs contempt toward Texas churches. Domain/Culture amplifies this reading via U.S. gun-and-church debates, so the American cultural context intensifies the mockery.",False
attitude_3259.png,attitude_3259,jamal! im pregnant!!!,the speaker,Jamal,Attitude,dominant_detachment,Intimate Relationships,General Culture,,NULL,Contemptuous,"[Anchor]
Text evidence: ""jamal! im pregnant!!!"" (tone: excited/positive). Visual evidence: close-up brown goat facing the camera; goat's face centered and prominent; snowy/blurred background. Cross-modal setup: the excited human-address pregnancy caption is paired with an animal close-up, creating an incongruent pairing that links the announcement to the goat image.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the text-image juxtaposition uses cross-modal tension to deride Jamal by implying a degrading association; this operates as Character Blaming. Minimal justification: the meme frames Jamal as morally diminished by the implied association between the pregnancy claim and the goat.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Contemptuous. The speaker (poster) is using the image-text pairing to mock and demean Jamal. Domain (Intimate Relationships) makes the implied partner/sex-related ridicule salient; Culture provides no additional disambiguation.",False

Text evidence: ""how they be lurking on your page"" (negative). Visual evidence: man in a suit peeking from behind a partition; only half his face visible; neutral expression; pale indoor background. Cross-modal setup: the text accuses others of 'lurking' while the image literally shows someone peeking, linking the label to a sneaky pose.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the wording frames the target as illegitimate nuisances and the photo's sneaky pose reinforces emotional cutoff, combining to treat their contributions as unworthy of engagement; this uses Invalidation as the sub-logic.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Dismissive. The poster expresses this stance toward people who lurk on their page to disagree. The Online & Social Media context frames such lurking as passive-aggressive, reinforcing the dismissive reading.",False

Text evidence: ""my kids watching me beat my wife:"" (negative). Visual evidence: young child with wide-eyed, raised-eyebrow expression; blue sweater with white collared shirt; plain pink studio background. Cross-modal setup: the caption frames spousal assault as humorous while the photo shows a child's shocked/surprised face.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the caption normalizes and makes light of violence, treating the wife's victimization as unimportant while the image records a witness; this interaction invalidates the victim's experience (Invalidation).
[Inference]
Attitude label: Dismissive. The speaker/parent is dismissive toward his wife by joking about assault. In the Family Conversations domain this humor functions to normalize and dismiss domestic violence.",False

Text evidence: ""this is my michael brown"" (negative tone). Visual evidence: a revolver on a wooden surface; several loose bullets; a pair of metal handcuffs. Cross-modal setup: the caption asserts possession while the photo shows weapons and restraints.

[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the possessive phrasing plus violent imagery treats the named person as an object and dismisses their personhood, combining high-ground dismissal in wording with weaponized visuals; this uses Invalidation as the operative sub-logic.

[Inference]
Attitude label: Hostile. The meme author expresses hostility toward Michael Brown by implying violent control/possession. Domain/Culture: In an American Public & Service context this evokes policing and makes a reading as endorsement of lethal force salient.",False
attitude_6583.png,attitude_6583,"how do you do, fellow kids? i am your new highly approachable candidate eager to share a beer",meme author,the candidate,Attitude,dominant_affiliation,Public & Service,General Culture,,NULL,Contemptuous,"[Anchor]
Text evidence: ""how do you do, fellow kids?"" (neutral literal tone). Visual evidence: close-up of an older person speaking; separate image of a young man in casual clothes holding a skateboard and wearing a backward cap. Cross-modal setup: the caption pretends friendly youth affiliation while the images show a clear age mismatch.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_affiliation. Trigger rule: the faux-familiar greeting and ""highly approachable candidate"" uses surface warmth to assert superiority and mock the target, activating the ""Talking Down"" sub-logic; the image of an older speaker addressing visibly younger people creates the patronizing pairing.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Contemptuous. The meme author expresses contempt toward the candidate's performative attempt to appear youthful. Domain/Culture provides context that this is a political/public-service parody, reinforcing the mockery rather than literal friendliness.",False

Text evidence: ""helping them have sex for generations"" (negative tone). Visual evidence: close-up of a shouting person pointing; multiple people behind with raised fists/arms and flags; outdoor crowd/protest setting. Cross-modal setup: the caption imputes sexual violence while the image shows an agitated collective, tying the allegation to the pictured group.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the wording attributes entrenched immoral behavior to the group and the photo supplies an identifiable collective target, enacting a moral-high-ground blame stance; this aligns with Character Blaming.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Contemptuous. The meme author (speaker) directs contempt at the depicted crowd by ascribing generational rape to them. Online & Social Media context frames this as public derogatory group-shaming; General Culture provides no additional disambiguation.",False
attitude_2828.png,attitude_2828,great minds think alike,meme creator,the two women pictured,Attitude,dominant_detachment,Public & Service,General Culture,,NULL,Contemptuous,"[Anchor]
Text evidence: ""great minds think alike"" — literal tone: positive. Visual evidence: two close-up photos of women with serious expressions; a donkey photo centered between them; meme-style bold white text over the donkey. Cross-modal setup: The complimentary phrase is layered over a donkey image placed between the two faces, creating an overt ironic juxtaposition.

[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: A positive-sounding line contrasts with a derogatory animal image, producing sarcasm and an assertion of superior judgment; this enacts Character Blaming by implying the women's stupidity. Minimal justification: the image-text tension lets the creator claim moral/intellectual high ground and dismiss the targets.

[Inference]
Attitude label: Contemptuous. Subject/target justification: The meme creator directs contempt toward the two women pictured. Domain/Culture provides no additional disambiguation.",False

Text evidence: ""a clitoris only tastes like piss for a second"" (negative tone). Visual evidence: two women tilting beer bottles to their mouths; casual tank tops; visible beer bottles with labels. Cross-modal setup: the text compares a clitoris to beer while the image shows women drinking beer, linking the bodily referent to the pictured women.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the speaker issues a derogatory, demeaning comparison that reduces women to an unpleasant attribute and the photo generalizes the insult to women; this operates via Character Blaming as the target is blamed/derided. Minimal justification: the wording is dismissive and the image provides a concrete group to which the insult attaches.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Contemptuous. The meme author (speaker) expresses contempt toward women by likening female genitalia to an unpleasant taste and associating that with the pictured women. The Online & Social Media setting favors shock/derogatory humor and reinforces the dismissive tone.",False

Text evidence: ""i woke up like this"" (positive/confident). Visual evidence: woman looking over her shoulder at camera; bed with red pillows; styled hair and slight smile/posed gaze. Cross-modal setup: caption claims effortless appearance while the photo shows a staged, flattering selfie. 
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_affiliation. Trigger rule: wording asserts effortless superiority while the posed image displays deliberate attractiveness, elevating the speaker above viewers; this uses the sub-logic Patronizing Praise. Minimal justification: the combined text-image frames naturalness as a marker of higher status. 
[Inference]
Attitude label: Dismissive. The poster (subject) projects dismissal toward other viewers/people who must work for appearance. Online & Social Media context frames this as performative boasting, reinforcing the dismissive reading.",False

Text evidence: ""doesn't own a computer can still play minesweeper""; literal tone: neutral. Visual evidence: group of children smiling and laughing at the camera; informal outdoor crowded scene; a child reaching toward the lens. Cross-modal setup: the caption makes a dark/ironic joke about ""minesweeper"" while the photo shows children in a non-digital, outdoor context, creating ironic tension.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the caption frames the scene as a punchline and emotionally cuts off concern, treating the subjects' situation as illegitimate to mourn; this fits the sub-logic ""Invalidation."" Minimal justification: ironic wording plus celebratory image asserts superior detachment.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Contemptuous. The meme author (subject) directs derision toward the pictured children/people without computers (target) by turning their context into a joke. Domain/Culture provides no additional disambiguation beyond common online meme irony.",False

Text evidence: ""must be time for more liberal bullshit"" (negative). Visual evidence: male speaker at a podium; checking his wristwatch; campaign-style red-white-blue backdrop and microphone. Cross-modal setup: The text insults 'liberals' while the photo shows a podium speaker looking at his watch, pairing derision with an authoritative image.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: The explicit derogation ('bullshit') combined with the pictured public speaker's high-ground posture and timing gesture enacts dismissal and moral/intellectual veto; this fits Invalidation. Minimal justification: verbal contempt plus an authoritative visual pose treats the target's views as illegitimate.

Text evidence: ""don't forget to set your bomb"" (literal tone: negative). Visual evidence: students seated at desks with open books; a boy in foreground looking at camera; several boys wearing white skullcaps. Cross-modal setup: The text invokes 'bomb' while the photo shows school-age boys in a religious classroom, linking violence to the pictured group.

[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: The caption frames violence as a casual attribute of the depicted group, taking a moral/high-ground dismissal of their character and attributing culpability; this matches Character Blaming. Minimal justification: wording plus the targeted classroom image asserts contempt rather than engagement.

[Inference]
Attitude label: Contemptuous. The meme author expresses contempt toward Muslims/the pictured students. Domain/Culture provides no additional disambiguation.",False

Visual evidence: two people wearing martial-arts uniforms; an older person standing in a guiding stance; a smaller child with fists raised practicing. Cross-modal setup: the exhortative slogan overlays a photo of an older youth instructing a younger trainee, matching encouragement to a clear age/authority difference. [Pivot] Mechanism: dominant_affiliation. Trigger rule: the combination of directive wording plus the older person's instructional posture creates a power-asymmetric, guidance-driven stance where encouragement functions from above (Talking Down). Minimal justification: the image frames the speaker as mentor and the message as instructive guidance. [Inference] Attitude label: Supportive. The speaker (poster) expresses encouragement toward the younger child/trainee. Domain/Culture provides no additional disambiguation.",False

Text evidence: ""we tried to keep it clean !"" (literal tone: positive). Visual evidence: overflowing public trash can; large pile of litter around the bin; scattered cans and bottles on the sidewalk. Cross-modal setup: the upbeat claim of cleanup directly contradicts the pictured mess.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_affiliation.

Minimal justification: the praise-plus-contradiction frames the community as ineffectual and the speaker as judgmental.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Dismissive. The speaker/uploader is dismissing the neighborhood/event attendees' efforts. The Public & Service domain frames this as a civic critique of collective cleanliness; General Culture provides no additional disambiguation.",False

- Visual evidence: woman wearing a Nathan's contest jersey and championship belt; man holding a large platter of hot dogs; branded event banner in background.
- Cross-modal setup: The caption sexualizes ""swallowing"" while the photo depicts a hot-dog eating/swallowing contest.
[Pivot]
- Mechanism: dominant_detachment.
- Trigger rule: The speaker takes a high-ground, dismissive stance by turning the woman's public achievement into a crude sexual joke, creating cross-modal tension that invalidates her competence; this matches the ""Invalidation"" sub-logic. Minimal justification: image shows accomplishment but text reduces it to an objectifying quip.

Text evidence: ""the first one can't sing when you put chains on it"" (negative). Visual evidence: two monkeys pressed against a chain-link fence; visible metal fencing; close-up faces showing confinement. Cross-modal setup: the caption makes a derogatory comparison about chaining/silencing while the image shows caged animals, producing a dehumanizing metaphor.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the wording dismisses and degrades the unnamed ""first one,"" and the animal-as-target image amplifies exclusion and moral judgment—this is Character Blaming. Minimal justification: the combined text-and-image frames the target as inferior and unworthy of respect.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Contemptuous. The speaker expresses contempt toward the 'first one' by likening them to a caged animal. In the Online & Social Media domain, pairing insulting captions with animal imagery commonly signals dehumanizing contempt.",False

Text evidence: ""adding coolant when the farm equipment overheats"" (neutral tone). Visual evidence: a young boy cupping water to his mouth; a stream of water falling onto his head; bare-chested outdoors with dirt background. Cross-modal setup: the neutral, practical caption is paired with the photo so the child visually stands in for the described 'coolant'.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the caption frames a pragmatic solution while the image instrumentalizes a person, producing moral indifference and emotional cutoff; this invokes Rationalizing Over as the speaker treats the pictured person as an obvious resource. Minimal justification: the text's matter-of-fact framing plus the image's instrumental use activate a detached, superior stance.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Contemptuous. The meme creator (speaker) implicitly positions the child in the photo as an expendable resource (target). Domain/Culture provides no additional disambiguation.",False

Visual evidence: two uniformed soldiers holding rifles; helmets and sunglasses; dusty desert base with military vehicles. Cross-modal setup: the text jokingly elevates bacon as a peacemaking force while the photo shows armed soldiers, creating a contrast between food-based unity and military force. [Pivot] Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the upbeat claim about bacon, paired with imagery of armed soldiers, functions to dismiss military solutions by treating them as unnecessary; this is Invalidation. Minimal justification: the juxtaposition frames the military as not the path to peace, positioning the speaker above wartime seriousness. [Inference] Attitude label: Dismissive. The subject (meme author/speaker) directs this stance toward the military/armed conflict by implying bacon, not weapons, could achieve peace.

Cross-modal setup: the caption's violent claim is paired with an ordinary family conversation image.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the caption attributes a violent act to the familial target and treats it as a punchline, asserting moral/character judgment and excluding sympathy; this is Character Blaming as the speaker pins blame on the target's character and dismisses them.

Visual evidence: television screen showing a news panel with an on-screen headline about sexual harassment; an overlaid Snapchat-style caption reading ""This shocks me! #sarcasm""; visible network branding. Cross-modal setup: the written exclamation claims surprise while the visible hashtag and context (a news story about allegations) indicate mockery of that claim.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the poster uses sarcastic wording and a mocking hashtag to negate sincere surprise and assert superiority over the news framing, creating emotional cutoff and dismissal; this is an instance of Invalidation. Minimal justification: the sarcasm converts a surface surprise into a refusal to treat the story as genuinely noteworthy.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Dismissive. The poster (subject) directs this dismissive stance at the news story about sexual harassment allegations (target). Domain/Culture note: as Online & Social Media, the performative hashtagged sarcasm signals public, performative dismissal rather than private disbelief.",False

Text evidence: ""i'm feeling suicidal"" (negative tone). Visual evidence: three-panel meme with men on phones; top and bottom panels show a smiling man in traditional Arab dress; middle panel shows a concerned man holding a phone. Cross-modal setup: the text quotes a hotline exchange while the images depict different callers/agents in phone-call poses.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the operator's reply dismisses and maligns the caller's crisis (text) while images of men in traditional dress enable a stereotyped turn; this counts as Invalidation of the caller's plea. Minimal justification: the wording treats the suicidal statement as illegitimate and reframes it as threat, and the visuals align with a cultural stereotype.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Contemptuous. The hotline operator (subject) is portrayed as holding contempt toward the suicidal caller (target) by trivializing and mocking their plea. Domain/Culture provides disambiguation: in a public-service hotline context and given visible Arab dress, the joke reads as stereotyping Arabs with terrorism, intensifying the dismissive contempt.",False

[Inference]
Attitude label: Contemptuous. The post author directs contempt/accusation toward the named political figures. In American Political Culture this frames a partisan, punitive stance rather than neutral inquiry.",False

Cross-modal setup: the caption pairs sexualized animal rear-ends with photos of men in Arab dress.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the wording mocks and delegitimizes the target while the image supplies demeaning, animalizing imagery, creating a high-ground, dismissive stance; Character Blaming is used. Minimal justification: pairing insult text with degrading visuals asserts superiority and rejects the target's dignity.

Visual evidence: boy pointing index finger at a seated dog; dog sitting and looking up attentively; plain indoor floor/wall.

Trigger rule: the wording praises patience as a rewarded virtue while the image shows a child exercising gentle authority over the dog, combining warmth and control to assert superiority; this is Benevolent Control because care is framed as governance of the dog's behavior. [Inference] Attitude label: Dismissive. The subject (the child/speaker) is positioned as holder of the attitude toward the target (the dog's immediate impulse/desire for reward).

Text evidence: ""alabama: bans abortions. all of alabama"" (literal tone: negative). Visual evidence: group of smiling people posing for a photo; mixed ages including older and younger adults; outdoor domestic setting with house and greenery.

Visual evidence: close-up of a pale face baring teeth; narrowed eyes; raised arm in foreground; blurred figures behind. Cross-modal setup: the caption reports expulsion while the image depicts a defiant, powerful dark-wizard persona.

[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: wording frames exclusion as the institution's act while the image projects emotional cutoff and superiority, creating a high-ground stance and attributing fault to the institution. This uses the ""Character Blaming"" sub-logic. Minimal justification: the complaint plus threatening imagery treats the institution as morally culpable.

Text evidence: ""haters will say it's photoshop"" (negative tone). Visual evidence: a single hand with multiple smaller hands at each fingertip; plain textured background; central, clearly composed image. Cross-modal setup: the caption preempts complaints about editing while the picture itself presents a surreal, plausibly edited visual.

Text evidence: ""oh look my new wife arrived"" — literal tone: neutral/positive.
Visual evidence: woman inside a large cardboard box with flaps open; only her eyes and forehead visible above the box rim; plain wooden‑paneled wall background.
Cross-modal setup: The caption frames the partner as a delivered package while the photo literally shows a person in a box.

[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment.
Trigger rule: The caption's ownership language ('arrived') plus the boxed person creates a high‑ground, dismissive framing that objectifies and sidelines the partner; this functions as Invalidation by denying agency. Minimal justification: wording asserts possession and the image literalizes containment, producing emotional cutoff.

[Inference]
Attitude label: Contemptuous.
Subject/target justification: The speaker (caption author) positions their wife as an object/delivery, indicating contempt toward the wife.

- Text evidence: ""so he fucked me and disapearred"" (negative).
- Visual evidence: woman with a distressed/pleading facial expression; hands clasped near mouth holding a tissue; bare shoulders and neutral backdrop.
- Cross-modal setup: the caption accuses a partner of sex-and-abandonment while the image depicts a hurt, vulnerable person, aligning victimhood with accusation.

Text evidence: ""once you ride a beard and a harley"" (positive). Visual evidence: bearded man; leather vest and bandana; studded wrist cuff and visible tattoo. Cross-modal setup: the text expresses sexualized admiration while the photo shows a prototypical bearded biker as the visual referent.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_affiliation. Trigger rule: the speaker uses an affiliative boast that frames the biker experience as a superior, desirable standard and the image supplies an exemplar, activating the Patronizing Praise sub-logic.

Text evidence: ""learn how he cured the gay"" (negative tone). Visual evidence: person aiming a shotgun directly at camera; gun barrel dominant in foreground; face blurred/indistinct. Cross-modal setup: the sensational 'cure' clickbait text sits atop a threatening image, linking 'cure' to enforced violence.

Text evidence: ""how you gotta treat girls with smart mouths"" (literal tone: negative). Visual evidence: office setting with large windows; two women in business attire smiling; a handshake with a man in the foreground. Cross-modal setup: the text prescribes how to 'treat' these women while the image shows a polite, friendly professional interaction.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_affiliation.

Attitude label: Dismissive. The speaker (text author) is positioned as holding a superior, dismissive stance toward the target group ('girls with smart mouths').

- Attitude label: Contemptuous. 
- Subject/target justification: the post author directs contempt toward the unnamed addressee by commanding and demeaning them. 
- Domain/Culture: the online social-media context frames this as a public, performative insult; General Culture provides no additional disambiguation.",False

Cross-modal setup: the caption invokes a shark while the photograph depicts vulnerable people at sea, linking predator imagery to the occupants.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the caption frames the boat occupants as appropriate objects of harm, asserting exclusion and moral high-ground through violent implication; sub-logic used: Character Blaming. Minimal justification: violent, dismissive wording plus dehumanizing visual pairing activates contemptuous dismissal.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Hostile. The poster expresses hostility toward the people on the boat. Domain/Culture provides no additional disambiguation.",False

Text evidence: ""your white friend got you"" (positive literal tone). Visual evidence: top panel shows two people embracing at a beach; bottom panel shows two hands reaching to scratch a person's back. Cross-modal setup: the text names a grateful helper and the images depict close physical assistance illustrating that help.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: submissive_alignment. Trigger rule: the wording frames the speaker as a beneficiary/dependent while the images show the friend providing direct physical aid, invoking the sub-logic ""Leaning on""; this combination signals dependence rather than equal reciprocity.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Appreciative. The speaker expresses gratitude toward their white friend (speaker → your white friend). Domain/Culture provides no additional disambiguation.",False
attitude_8949.png,attitude_8949,for the last time im not michelle obama,text author,Michelle Obama,Attitude,dominant_detachment,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,NULL,Contemptuous,"[Anchor]
Text evidence: ""for the last time im not michelle obama"" (negative/exasperated). Visual evidence: person in an ape-like costume with visible fur and prosthetic face; dense green/wooded background; outstretched hand. Cross-modal setup: the denial in text is juxtaposed with an animalized figure in the image, suggesting a visual comparison.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: cross-modal tension (text negation + ape-like image) creates a high-ground, dismissive posture that degrades the named person; this uses Character Blaming as the sub-logic.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Contemptuous. The meme's speaker expresses contempt toward Michelle Obama by pairing a denial with a demeaning visual comparison. Domain/Culture: online meme context reinforces mocking intent.",False
attitude_3448.png,attitude_3448,mr. wilson you have to take your pill with water . you can't crush it up and snort it off my tits,the doctor,Mr. Wilson,Attitude,dominant_detachment,Workplace,General Culture,,NULL,Contemptuous,"[Anchor]
Text evidence: ""you can't crush it up and snort it off my tits"" (negative). Visual evidence: woman in a white coat with stethoscope; older man seated facing her; clinical waiting-room window light. Cross-modal setup: the image shows a professional clinician-patient interaction while the text is a blunt, sexualized prohibition.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the speaker uses imperatives and a prohibitive, shaming phrase to veto the patient's proposed action, asserting moral/intellectual superiority; this enacts Invalidation. Minimal justification: the wording dismisses and ridicules the patient's behavior while the clinical setting reinforces the speaker's higher-power role.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Contemptuous. The doctor (subject) expresses contempt toward Mr. Wilson (target) by denying and mocking his suggested action. Domain (Workplace) frames this as professional boundary enforcement, reinforcing the power asymmetry.",False
attitude_5148.png,attitude_5148,when you're given an n-word pass but you can't help but still be super white howdy-ho negroes,meme author,white person,Attitude,dominant_detachment,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,NULL,Contemptuous,"[Anchor]
Text evidence: ""howdy-ho negroes"" (negative/derogatory). Visual evidence: young white man wearing glasses; raised, awkwardly open hand wave; plain gray T-shirt and neutral backdrop. Cross-modal setup: the caption uses a faux-friendly slur while the photo shows an awkward white person, aligning to mockery.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the caption adopts a dismissive, derisive stance toward the depicted person's attempt to use the slur, blaming their character as irredeemably ""super white"" (Character Blaming); the image reinforces ridicule by portraying the subject as inept.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Contemptuous. The meme author (subject) directs contempt at the depicted white person (target) by pairing mocking text with an awkward portrait. Domain amplifies performative mockery typical of online memes; culture provides no additional disambiguation.",False
intent_7008.png,intent_7008,did you know that pigs are cannibals? disgusting savages,meme author,people pictured,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,dehumanize,,"[Anchor] The caption uses animalizing insults—""pigs are cannibals"" and ""disgusting savages""—while the photo shows people sampling roasted pork. [Pivot] Juxtaposing the animal claim with the image links the derogatory language to the depicted humans, turning a surface “fact” into a veiled attack; it’s not informative but disparaging. The meme uses indirect insults and metaphor to express hostility rather than a direct argument. [Inference] This combination reveals a strategic goal to demean and assert dominance over the pictured/targeted people, i.e., to dehumanize them.",False
attitude_3832.png,attitude_3832,protesting death to the middle east,post author,protesters in the image,Attitude,dominant_detachment,Public & Service,Arab Culture,,NULL,Contemptuous,"[Anchor]
Text evidence: ""protesting death to the middle east"" (negative tone). Visual evidence: close-up of several men with open mouths as if shouting; raised arms; visible traditional headwear. Cross-modal setup: the caption attributes a violent slogan to the depicted crowd, aligning text with the shouting scene.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the caption assigns culpable, violent intent to the group, asserting moral judgment and elevating the author's normative stance; image amplification makes this a case of Character Blaming. Minimal justification: wording imposes a condemning interpretation while the photo's anger cues are used to justify dismissal.
[Inference]
Attitude label: Contemptuous. The post author frames the protesters in the image as violent, so the author's attitude targets those pictured. Domain/Culture emphasizes public protest imagery in an Arab context, strengthening the condemnatory reading rather than providing neutral information.",False
attitude_5026.png,attitude_5026,i got arrested for punching this guy at a new years party. when you hear an arab counting down from ten your instincts kick in,speaker,Arabs,Attitude,dominant_detachment,Public & Service,Arab Culture,,NULL,Contemptuous,"[Anchor]
Text evidence: ""when you hear an arab counting down from ten"" (negative). Visual evidence: bearded man wearing a helmet; visible bandage over one eye; holding a large cigar; direct stare. Cross-modal setup: the caption frames an ethnic group as an immediate threat while the image depicts a rough-looking male as the implied target.

[Pivot]
Mechanism: dominant_detachment. Trigger rule: the wording attributes dangerous intent to the target's identity and morally justifies violence, claiming a superior, dismissive stance toward them—this is Character Blaming. The image reinforces a dehumanized target rather than mitigating the claim.

[Inference]
Attitude label: Contemptuous. The speaker (""I"") expresses contempt toward Arabs by framing them as instinctive threats deserving assault. Domain/Culture clarifies this as ethnicized public-threat framing rather than neutral danger.",False
intent_3803.png,intent_3803,i fuck goats allah is great!,poster,muslims,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,Arab Culture,,insult muslims,,"[Anchor] The surface text pairs a shocking obscene claim with a religious exclamation over a photo of an agitated crowd that cues a Muslim identity. [Pivot] This juxtaposition is not reporting or seeking help but deliberately sacrilegious and inflammatory; the image amplifies group association while the crude wording masks a hostile goal. [Inference] Taken together this is an indirect aggressive act meant to provoke, demean, and elicit outrage toward Muslims rather than convey literal information.",False
intent_5437.png,intent_5437,"maga bois when they see trump coming for suppressors ""you were supposed to be the chosen one!!!",meme creator,maga supporters,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,ridicule,,"[Anchor] The meme pairs a betrayed-Jedi image and the line ""you were supposed to be the chosen one!!!"" with a photo of a MAGA hat and the caption about ""maga bois"" and suppressors; on the surface it reads as humor. [Pivot] Cross-modal alignment of pop-culture betrayal imagery and a political symbol reframes a playful quote as a pointed attack: the image supplies the emotional betrayal frame while the caption supplies the political target, turning joke into social critique. [Inference] The unstated communicative goal is to publicly mock and humiliate that group, using indirect sarcasm rather than explicit argument.",False
intent_11385.png,intent_11385,international day against violence,victims of violence,general public,Intent,benevolent_provocation,Public & Service,General Culture,,raise awareness,,"[Anchor] The caption is a neutral campaign title, while the photo shows a young woman with a black eye and bandaged hand, a vivid depiction of physical harm. [Pivot] This cross-modal mismatch—informational text paired with shocking, emotive imagery—suggests the creator chose provocation rather than mere description. The image is used as a tool to elicit strong feelings and draw attention beyond the literal event name. [Inference] The implicit intent is to provoke public attention and increase awareness about violence and its victims, motivating empathy and support.",False
intent_7056.png,intent_7056,30 minutes after eating taco bell,meme creator,Taco Bell,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,mock taco bell,,"[Anchor] The surface text is a neutral temporal phrase while the image shows a massive nuclear-style explosion. The combination is a classic meme template pairing mundane wording with an extreme visual. [Pivot] This cross-modal mismatch transforms a literal time statement into a vivid metaphor for an explosive bodily reaction after eating at Taco Bell, using hyperbole rather than factual claim. [Inference] The unstated communicative goal is to ridicule and vent about Taco Bell's food by provoking shock and amusement, i.e., indirectly attacking the brand through exaggerated humor.",False
intent_5311.png,intent_5311,when you eating in a chinese resturant and you hear a dog barking in the kitchen.,speaker,chinese restaurants,Intent,expressive_aggression,Public & Service,East Asian Culture,,denigrate chinese cuisine,,"[Anchor] The caption posits a mundane scene—hearing a dog bark in a Chinese restaurant—while the image is an extreme closeup of a horrified, disgusted face. [Pivot] The exaggerated visual reaction combined with a culture-specific setting turns the neutral observation into a derogatory implication (that dogs are being cooked), relying on stereotype rather than literal report. [Inference] The post’s communicative goal is to mock and demean Chinese food/culture indirectly, using shock and stereotype to vent hostility and reinforce prejudice rather than convey information.",False
intent_10207.png,intent_10207,when you catch your goat with another man,jealous partner,other man,Intent,expressive_aggression,Intimate Relationships,General Culture,,intimidate,,"[Anchor] The caption frames a discovery of a partner with someone else while the photo shows a group of men restraining and assaulting a single man. [Pivot] The surface joke about 'catching your goat' contrasts with the violent, collective physical response in the image, indicating the meme stages a retaliatory scene rather than stating it outright. [Inference] Combining text and violent visual cues suggests a hidden goal to threaten or punish the rival and assert dominance, i.e., to intimidate the perceived interloper.",False
intent_6644.png,intent_6644,"what's a word that begins with n, ends in r and you never want to call a black person? a neighbour",meme creator,Black people,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,intimidate,,"[Anchor] The text frames a classic n-word setup then delivers a pun punchline; superficially humorous, it explicitly invokes a racial slur referent and directs discourse toward a protected group. [Pivot] The image of a woman brandishing a rifle in a domestic setting shifts the frame from joke to menace—weaponized posture and proximity imply potential violence rather than benign wordplay. [Inference] Together the caption and photo show an intent to threaten and assert dominance over Black people through coded language and implied physical danger, i.e., to intimidate.",False
intent_11759.png,intent_11759,"muslim terrorist, spy anti semite the poster child of the left",meme creator,the left,Intent,malicious_manipulation,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,discredit the left,,"[Anchor] The overlaid text strings use extreme accusatory labels — ""muslim terrorist, spy anti semite"" — and then brands the person as ""the poster child of the left,"" presenting a clear defamatory claim. [Pivot] The claim is paired with a portrait-style photo of a public-facing woman in a meme format, linking sensational allegations directly to a visible political figure and to the broader political group. [Inference] Together this indicates a hidden goal to delegitimize and demonize the left by exploiting fear and moral outrage, manipulating viewers to withdraw support or mobilize hostility.",False
intent_6232.png,intent_6232,goats can't talk why are so few muslim rapes reported?,meme author,muslims,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,dehumanize muslims,,"[Anchor] The surface reads as a provocative question about underreported rapes overlaid on a photo of many Muslim men. [Pivot] Combining an animal reference with a rhetorical question directed at a photographed group obscures an accusatory claim and leverages disgust to degrade the depicted group rather than request information. [Inference] The pragmatic goal is not literal inquiry but indirect hostile messaging to humiliate and stigmatize Muslims, consistent with expressive aggression aimed at establishing dominance and venting prejudice online.",False
intent_3550.png,intent_3550,it's hard to be first class when you're white trash,meme creator,people labeled white trash,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,belittle,,"[Anchor] The meme pairs a polished, outdoorsy man striking a confident pose with the caption ""it's hard to be first class when you're white trash,"" which explicitly disparages a socioeconomic/racial group. [Pivot] The visual projects aspiration while the text degrades that identity, creating ridicule through contrast; this is not seeking information or help but using humor to attack. [Inference] The combined multimodal cues indicate an intent to belittle and assert superiority over the targeted group online, fitting expressive_aggression.",False
intent_3159.png,intent_3159,"chelsea clinton.. so ugly that when she gives head, it counts as anal",meme creator,Chelsea Clinton,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,humiliate,,"[Anchor] The surface text is a crude, sexualized insult overlaid on a clear portrait-style photo; it appears as a joke but directly references a named individual. [Pivot] Cross-modal cues — a personal image plus public meme format and explicit degradation — point beyond mere venting: the creator uses humor as a vehicle to single out and shame a specific person for public consumption. The image anchors the attack to an identifiable target and the caption weaponizes ridicule. [Inference] The implicit communicative goal (intent) is to humiliate.",False
intent_6386.png,intent_6386,what's burning? '' '' '',meme creator,Holocaust victims,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,taunt victims,,"[Anchor] The meme superficially asks what's burning? placed over a smiling archival portrait long associated with Holocaust imagery, producing a jaunty surface tone. [Pivot] That bright, casual framing clashes with the grave historical context evoked by the photograph; the juxtaposition reframes a literal question about fire as ironic, displacing the real referent and masking hostility behind humor. [Inference] The cross-modal mismatch implies the creator's goal is not curiosity but to provoke and taunt victims indirectly, using shock and dark humor as an aggressive communicative tool.",False
intent_9206.png,intent_9206,"kids catch you in the kitchen... ""what's in your mouth?"" and i am standing there like, nothing... """,adult,kids,Intent,prosocial_deception,Family Conversations,General Culture,,avoid getting caught,,"[Anchor] The meme text is a denial—""nothing...""—while the image shows a small animal with stuffed cheeks, visually contradicting the claim. [Pivot] This cross-modal mismatch (verbal denial vs. obvious visual evidence) is a classic disguise: the speaker frames a harmless surface reply to deflect suspicion from children who might scold or forbid snacking. The humor relies on hiding an act rather than admitting it. [Inference] The implicit intent is to conceal the truth to avoid being caught or reprimanded, preserving face and preventing conflict.",False
intent_7802.png,intent_7802,"when yo finna play w/ yo self, then you think about yo dead relatives thats watching",meme creator,the targeted person,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,shame someone,,"[Anchor] The caption jokes about masturbating while 'dead relatives' watch and is overlaid on a photo of a gorilla peeking from foliage. [Pivot] The animal’s voyeuristic stare combined with a crude familial accusation turns a humorous surface line into a personal attack: the image amplifies surveillance and ridicule, moving the joke away from neutral absurdity toward targeting an individual’s dignity. [Inference] Taken together, the meme implicitly aims to mock and disgrace the referenced person—an indirect aggressive jab designed to shame someone rather than inform or request.",False
intent_7020.png,intent_7020,what do you get when you see bill cosby in double vision raped,meme creator,pictured public figure,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,humiliate publicly,,"[Anchor] The image shows a recognizable public figure while the caption delivers a blunt sexual-violence punchline referencing that figure; on the surface it presents as a shocking joke. [Pivot] Cross-modal alignment (visual identification + violent humor) turns the apparent joke into an indirect attack: the poster uses shock comedy to displace direct critique and vent hostility without argument. [Inference] The pragmatic aim is thus to humiliate publicly, leveraging sexual-violence imagery to demean and assert dominance over the target.",False
intent_3718.png,intent_3718,"so you're telling me that black people ""stole"" the n-word from white people? typical",meme author,person claiming black people stole the n-word,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,mock opponent,,"[Anchor] The text sarcastically questions someone who says Black people ""stole"" the n-word and appends ""typical,"" while the image is a harmless-looking puppy meme. [Pivot] The cute dog visually softens delivery, turning a hostile dismissal into seemingly playful content; quotation marks and sarcasm signal dismissal of the other person's claim rather than a neutral discussion. [Inference] Combined, these cues indicate the poster's hidden goal is to indirectly attack and belittle the claimant by mocking their view rather than engaging seriously.",False
intent_6090.png,intent_6090,from 16 indictments to nothing! thanks 'white privilege!',meme creator,advocates of white privilege,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,mock white privilege,,"[Anchor] The caption sarcastically credits ‘white privilege’ for a legal reversal while pairing Michelle Obama (top) and a photographed celebrity accused of wrongdoing (bottom), creating a racial and political frame. [Pivot] The visual-text juxtaposition converts apparent commentary into a taunt: the quoted thanks is ironic, the images cue public figures tied to race discourse, and the meme targets the idea rather than reporting facts. [Inference] The unstated communicative goal is to deride and undermine proponents of white privilege via indirect insult and ridicule.",False
intent_6117.png,intent_6117,diversity is our greatest strength,organization,employee,Intent,malicious_manipulation,Workplace,General Culture,,mask harassment,,"[Anchor] The caption ""diversity is our greatest strength"" is an explicit pro‑inclusion claim, while the photo depicts a dominant coworker looming over a cowering colleague in a workplace corridor. [Pivot] The strong mismatch between the laudatory text and the image of intimidation implies the slogan is being deployed to paper over or legitimize abusive behavior rather than to express genuine inclusion. [Inference] This indicates malicious manipulation: presenting moral rhetoric as cover for coercion, so the underlying intent is to mask harassment.",False
intent_10813.png,intent_10813,when you know you don't have to jackoff tonight,poster,peers,Intent,benevolent_provocation,Intimate Relationships,General Culture,,show off sexual success,,"[Anchor] The caption explicitly references not needing to masturbate tonight while the photo shows a smiling couple taking a celebratory selfie with drinks. This is a public, upbeat depiction rather than a private admission. [Pivot] The text and image together turn a private sexual outcome into a visible status cue: relief about not masturbating is reframed as evidence of hookup availability and social desirability. [Inference] The implicit intent is to provoke social reactions—boast and elicit envy or admiration from peers by showcasing recent sexual success through a humorous image caption.",False
intent_4974.png,intent_4974,"in 2011 trump said ""all americans are idiots"" in 2016 they proved it",meme poster,american voters,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,mock american voters,,"[Anchor] The caption bluntly restates an insult about Americans while the photo shows two men in a formal political setting, signalling a political meme aimed at a civic audience. [Pivot] Rather than reporting a verifiable event, the juxtaposition turns into a rhetorical swipe: the text generalizes and derides an electorate, and the image provides political context that amplifies the ridicule. [Inference] Pragmatically, the poster’s goal is to indirectly attack and shame American voters, using sarcasm and public mockery to vent political hostility.",False
intent_9116.png,intent_9116,"hurry up son, the owner is coming",father,owner,Intent,prosocial_deception,Family Conversations,General Culture,,avoid getting caught,,"[Anchor] The explicit line ""hurry up son, the owner is coming"" frames urgency and imminent discovery by a third party. [Pivot] The photo shows a father closely guiding a young child on a bicycle; paired with that warning, the scene implies they may be using someone else's bike or otherwise risk being seen. [Inference] Taken together the unstated communicative goal is to move the child out of sight to prevent confrontation or consequence, i.e., to avoid getting caught.",False
intent_6973.png,intent_6973,"""america has stolen the jews the jews of god his jewelry the negroes they are the true hebrews"" google it",meme poster,Jewish and Black people,Intent,malicious_manipulation,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,promote racist propaganda,,"[Anchor] The image pairs a black-and-white portrait of a historical authoritarian figure with a quoted racist claim about Jews and Black people plus the imperative ""google it."" [Pivot] The visual of authority combined with an instruction to verify reframes a hateful falsehood as something discoverable and legitimate rather than presenting an explicit persuasive argument. This cross-modal framing leverages perceived credibility and user curiosity. [Inference] The poster's hidden goal is to manipulate viewers into accepting and spreading the racist conspiracy as credible evidence.",False
intent_10151.png,intent_10151,voting for hillary is like letting casey anthony watch your kids because she's not guilty,meme creator,Hillary Clinton,Intent,malicious_manipulation,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,discredit hillary,,"[Anchor] The meme pairs a laughing Hillary photo with an image of Casey Anthony and the text equating voting for Hillary to letting Casey Anthony watch your kids because she's not guilty. This juxtaposition links Clinton to an infamous, distrusted figure. [Pivot] The surface is a provocative comparison, not a literal request; jointly the images and text weaponize a moral panic and guilt/shock association to influence perception. [Inference] The poster therefore seeks to undermine trust and sway public opinion by smearing Clinton's character — a covert persuasive attack that exploits fear and disgust to manipulate voters, i.e. malicious_manipulation aiming to discredit hillary.",False
intent_11831.png,intent_11831,i was asked who my favourite x-men character was apparently my answer was inappropriate,poster,online audience,Intent,benevolent_provocation,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,provoke reaction,,"[Anchor] The surface text frames an innocuous question about a favourite X‑Men character; the accompanying photo shows a costumed, attention-grabbing character which visually primes sexualized or sensational readings. [Pivot] The line ""apparently my answer was inappropriate"" creates a contrast between a neutral topic and a claim of impropriety, implying the reply was chosen to elicit shock or amusement rather than to inform. [Inference] Combining the provocative visual cue with the teasing caption indicates the hidden intent is to provoke a reaction from viewers and draw attention online.",False
intent_9177.png,intent_9177,symbol of stupidity,meme author,depicted people,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,demean others,,"[Anchor] The image-plus-caption pairs the blunt phrase ""symbol of stupidity"" with a visual of multiple people whose heads are obscured by clouds, producing a blanket derogatory metaphor directed at the pictured figures. [Pivot] Rather than stating a factual claim, the meme uses metaphorical imagery and a sweeping label to mock and displace a target group anonymously, which is an indirect, nonargumentative attack common online. [Inference] The pragmatic goal revealed by this cross-modal pairing is to insult and demean others, asserting superiority through ridicule.",False
intent_6938.png,intent_6938,when a person tells you that your meme meme or joke was heavily offensive i can go lower,speaker,critics,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,provoke critics,,"[Anchor] The text explicitly frames a reaction to being called offensive with the line ""i can go lower,"" while the photo shows an exaggerated, confrontational pose that highlights performative boldness. [Pivot] The surface phrasing pretends to be a casual remark, but paired with the staging it signals an intent to retaliate rather than reconcile: the speaker is choosing escalation over apology. [Inference] Cross-modal cues therefore reveal a hidden goal of deliberately provoking or antagonizing critics online, consistent with expressive_aggression.",False
intent_11464.png,intent_11464,"hey, baby i'm getting dinner started you gonna help out or just stand there? wtf, srsly?",speaker,partner,Intent,malicious_manipulation,Intimate Relationships,General Culture,,pressure compliance,,"[Anchor] The caption directly asks a romantic partner to ""help out"" with dinner while adding an accusatory ""wtf, srsly?""; the paired images depict lions in mounting and predatory scenarios, blending sexual and dominance imagery. [Pivot] This multimodal mismatch reframes a simple household request as a challenge and shaming move: the animal visuals and hostile tone convert coordination into a power play and implied threat of humiliation. [Inference] The hidden communicative goal is to force immediate cooperation by exploiting guilt and dominance cues rather than a straightforward cooperative appeal.",False
intent_8564.png,intent_8564,when you run over antifa protestors and you hear one being dragged,meme poster,antifa protestors,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,incite violence,,"[Anchor] The caption graphically describes running over ""antifa protestors"" and hearing someone dragged; the accompanying photo shows a smiling, relaxed man, converting the violent scene into a punchline. [Pivot] That juxtaposition turns explicit violence into celebratory humor, displacing direct confrontation into an online joke and reducing perceived culpability while endorsing harm. [Inference] Combined, the text-image pairing functions as indirect aggression that glorifies and promotes physical harm to a political group, aiming to intimidate or rally others toward violent action on social media.",False
intent_4900.png,intent_4900,this faceapp stuff is incredible!,poster,woman in headscarf,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,dehumanize,,"[Anchor] The surface message praises a photo-editing app while the image juxtaposes a headshot of a woman in a headscarf over an image of a bearded man in similar traditional headwear, using a before/after meme layout. [Pivot] The positive text plus the visual swap creates a sarcastic transformation: admiration of the app becomes a vehicle to equate the woman with the other man, turning a tech comment into an attack. [Inference] The poster’s hidden goal is to ridicule and stigmatize the woman by linking her to hostile/extremist imagery, i.e., to dehumanize.",False
intent_6227.png,intent_6227,what stopped a suicidal boy from jumping? the rope,meme poster,online audience,Intent,benevolent_provocation,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,shock for laughs,,"[Anchor] The meme text frames a serious setup — ""what stopped a suicidal boy from jumping?"" — then supplies a blunt punchline ""the rope."" Visually, three panels show playful, smiling huskies that imply lightheartedness rather than empathy. [Pivot] The contrast between sympathetic expectations (a consoling answer) and an incongruous, taboo joke creates a deliberate surprise; the cute dog imagery softens the delivery while the wording misleads the viewer into expecting seriousness, amplifying shock. [Inference] The poster's hidden intent is to provoke shock for laughs and drive engagement through taboo humor.",False
intent_4123.png,intent_4123,if you got your phone wet try leaving it in dry rice overnight it will attract asians who will fix your electronics for you,meme poster,asians,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,deride Asians,,"[Anchor] The caption offers a faux-helpful tip (put your phone in rice) then delivers a punchline claiming it will ""attract asians who will fix your electronics for you."" The photo of a stereotypical redneck figure frames the line as a joke. [Pivot] Combining a racial stereotype in text with a mocking image turns a surface-level quip into a derogatory act, not a genuine recommendation. [Inference] The communicator's hidden goal is to belittle and mock Asians through indirect, humor-masked aggression.",False
intent_10719.png,intent_10719,tranny for sale,poster,transgender person,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,dehumanize,,"[Anchor] The image shows a person’s portrait with the overlaid caption ""tranny for sale"", which on surface reads like a shocking meme or crude label. [Pivot] Combining a derogatory slur with a photo in an online meme context doesn't plausibly announce a genuine transaction; instead the slur and visual target work together to objectify and reduce the person, turning identity into consumable content. [Inference] This cross-modal pattern points to an implicit aggressive communicative goal: to dehumanize, humiliate, and assert dominance over a transgender individual in an online setting.",False
intent_4430.png,intent_4430,when the booze kicks in and you start putting out the vibes,poster,viewers,Intent,benevolent_provocation,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,seek attention,,"[Anchor] The caption frames a casual drunken scenario—""when the booze kicks in and you start putting out the vibes""—while the photo shows an exaggerated, suggestive pose that reads comical rather than literal. [Pivot] The humor arises from the clash between the seductive claim and the unlikely image, a cross-modal incongruity that functions to provoke amusement and social response rather than to state a factual desire. [Inference] The meme's covert communicative goal is to draw attention and engagement by simulating flirtatious behavior, i.e., to seek attention.",False
intent_3674.png,intent_3674,canadian border jumper detained by american patriot,meme creator,canadian border crossers,Intent,malicious_manipulation,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,glorify vigilantism,,"[Anchor] The image shows a uniformed person hugging someone warmly while the overlaid text claims a 'canadian border jumper detained by american patriot.' The surface reads like a factual or celebratory caption, while the photo conveys affection. [Pivot] This cross-modal mismatch reframes a punitive act (detention) as compassionate patriotism: the affectionate image masks the harm and recasts it as virtue. [Inference] The meme's implicit intent is to manipulate viewers into admiring or accepting extrajudicial enforcement, effectively glorifying vigilantism under the guise of patriotism.",False
intent_9550.png,intent_9550,your black neighbor after you called the cops,meme creator,black neighbor,Intent,expressive_aggression,Public & Service,General Culture,,dehumanize,,"[Anchor] The image-text pair places the caption ""your black neighbor after you called the cops"" over a laughing ape photo; the surface reads as a joking depiction of someone's reaction. [Pivot] The cross-modal combination of a racial descriptor with animal imagery invokes a dehumanizing trope; instead of requesting or informing, the meme uses humor to mask hostility and to ridicule the labeled person. [Inference] The creator's implicit intent is to demean and assert dominance over a Black neighbor via indirect aggressive dehumanization.",False
intent_5138.png,intent_5138,when someone tells me women must serve men,speaker,sexist interlocutor,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,challenge sexism,,"[Anchor] The caption frames a reaction to the claim ""women must serve men,"" while the photo shows uniformed female soldiers handling weapons. [Pivot] Juxtaposing the sexist line with images of armed, trained women converts the surface complaint into a sarcastic retort that refuses subservience and highlights capability. [Inference] Cross-modal signaling indicates an indirect aggressive rebuttal: the meme seeks to confront and undermine sexist beliefs by showcasing women's authority and competence rather than stating a calm counterargument.",False
intent_11303.png,intent_11303,down syndrome girl put on makeup for a party,meme poster,person with Down syndrome,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,mock,,"[Anchor] The surface text is a blunt descriptive caption and the image shows a woman with Down syndrome applying makeup; the visual plus meme-style top/bottom text creates a typical humorous framing. [Pivot] In online meme culture such neutral-seeming captions paired with a marginalized person's image often function to invite derision rather than to inform, turning a factual scene into a target for ridicule. The poster likely intends to prompt amusement at the subject's expense rather than respectful depiction. [Inference] The hidden communicative goal is to mock the person in the image.",False
intent_6753.png,intent_6753,my husband does everything i ask but i have to ask,wife,husband,Intent,expressive_aggression,Intimate Relationships,General Culture,,guilt trip him,,"[Anchor] The caption explicitly notes the husband complies only after being asked while the photo shows a distressed, tearful woman—a plaintive personal complaint framed as a meme. [Pivot] That cross-modal pairing creates a surface–deep mismatch: rather than neutrally reporting, the public, emotional presentation functions as an indirect reproach aimed beyond literal content. [Inference] The speaker’s likely hidden goal is to vent and indirectly coerce change by provoking guilt or social shame in the husband rather than confronting him directly.",False
intent_11698.png,intent_11698,oops. broke the dishwasher again,speaker,household,Intent,prosocial_deception,Family Conversations,General Culture,,seek forgiveness,,"[Anchor] The text is a brief self-admission: ""oops. broke the dishwasher again."" The photo shows a woman standing beside a sudsy overflowing dishwasher with a sheepish, nonchalant pose. [Pivot] The combination of casual phrasing (""oops"") and a light, apologetic posture creates a surface-level playful admission rather than a direct problem-solving request. This softens responsibility and reframes the mishap as minor, signaling concern for relational reaction more than logistics. [Inference] Pragmatically, the speaker is downplaying the fault to maintain harmony and elicit leniency from household members, i.e., to seek forgiveness.",False
intent_0189.jpg,intent_0189,when the exam is easy a . f,student,classmates,Intent,expressive_aggression,Education & Campus,General Culture,,show off,,"[Anchor] The caption asks ""how was today's exam"" while the image shows a person labeled ME casually flinging many labeled items (7M, 3M, 4M, QTS.1, QTS.2) like trophies. Visually the responder is nonchalant and ostentatious rather than giving a simple report. [Pivot] That surface Q&A frame conflicts with the visual performance: instead of answering, the subject stages a display of abundance/answers. The cross-modal mismatch signals a strategic communicative move beyond mere information. [Inference] The hidden goal is to boast and assert superiority to peers by flaunting how well they did — i.e., to show off.",False
intent_11431.png,intent_11431,the day that shook new york city,content creator,viewers,Intent,benevolent_provocation,Public & Service,General Culture,,sensationalize,,"[Anchor] The text is a terse, dramatic headline while the image graphically shows the Twin Towers exploding, creating a strong surface–deep contrast between neutral reportage and vivid shock imagery. [Pivot] Pairing a headline-style caption with a sensational, emotionally charged photo suggests a strategic choice to amplify attention rather than simply inform—the creator leverages imagery to provoke a reaction. [Inference] Thus the implicit intent is to sensationalize the tragedy to elicit engagement from viewers (poster targets audience attention) rather than deliver calm factual reporting.",False
intent_4510.png,intent_4510,it's not a hijab it's a diaper for people with shit for brains,meme author,Muslim woman,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,Muslim Culture,,dehumanize,,"[Anchor] The image shows a woman wearing a headscarf paired with text that explicitly calls the hijab a ""diaper"" and the wearers ""shit for brains,"" producing a clear insulting surface message. [Pivot] The insult targets a visible marker of Muslim identity; pairing the demeaning metaphor with the photographed person shifts the act from mere opinion to identity-based denigration, using ridicule rather than argument. [Inference] The hidden communicative goal is to humiliate and strip the target of dignity online, asserting dominance through aggressive mockery.",False
intent_7005.png,intent_7005,look son... another terror attack by peaceful muslims!,father/speaker,muslims,Intent,malicious_manipulation,Family Conversations,General Culture,,incite prejudice,,"[Anchor] The caption pairs a sarcastic accusation about ""peaceful muslims"" with an image of a father pointing something out to his son, framing the line as a teaching moment. [Pivot] The familial visual context turns a hostile stereotype into a purported lesson, leveraging parental authority and trust while presenting the attack as casual commentary. [Inference] This cross-modal combination signals a manipulative goal: to implant and normalize anti-Muslim hostility in a listener/audience by disguising prejudice as benign instruction.",False
intent_8207.png,intent_8207,when you poke holes in his condoms and get aids instead of a baby,female partner,male partner,Intent,malicious_manipulation,Intimate Relationships,General Culture,,sabotage contraception,,"[Anchor] The text explicitly depicts deliberately poking holes in a partner's condoms to secure pregnancy, while the photo shows a distressed woman covering her face and an angry man behind her. [Pivot] Together the caption and image frame the act as a covert tactic that exploits sexual trust; the meme’s dark humor masks a deliberate violation of consent and bodily safety. [Inference] The implied communicative goal is not sympathy or confession but to normalize exploiting a partner’s vulnerability to force pregnancy — a malicious manipulation to sabotage contraception.",False
intent_4461.png,intent_4461,ancestry.com the results are in,meme creator,person in image,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,dehumanize,,"[Anchor] The caption ""ancestry.com the results are in"" paired with a top panel of monkeys and a bottom panel of a speaking woman presents a surface-level joke about ancestry. [Pivot] The multimodal pairing deliberately invites viewers to infer a biological comparison rather than convey factual information; the text avoids an explicit insult while the image alignment implies a demeaning equivalence. [Inference] This pattern is an indirect, aggressive attack: it uses humor and imagery to vent contempt and stigmatize the depicted individual, so the hidden intent is to dehumanize them.",False
intent_7442.png,intent_7442,now that's a koala-ty photo,poster,photo subject,Intent,benevolent_provocation,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,flirt subtly,,"[Anchor] The surface text is a playful pun ""koala-ty"" paired with a top-panel image of an attractive woman and a bottom-panel koala, framing the message as humorous praise. [Pivot] This cross-modal pairing masks a direct compliment by using a joke, trading literal description for misdirection; the meme's humor functions as a lightweight provocation to elicit attention, likes, or a flirtatious response. [Inference] Therefore the underlying communicative goal is not mere description but to tease and gain social/romantic engagement from viewers—i.e., to flirt subtly.",False
intent_9757.png,intent_9757,when you sleep with a jewish girl,meme author,jewish people,Intent,expressive_aggression,Intimate Relationships,General Culture,,demean jewish people,,"[Anchor] The surface text is a punchline setup referencing sex with a Jewish girl; the photo shows a smiling rabbi holding a couple's hands in a synagogue, which reads as a benign religious scene. [Pivot] Placed together the image repurposes a neutral religious context into a sexualized joke that links individual intimacy to a whole faith, creating an implied stereotype rather than stating a literal claim. [Inference] The combined effect is an indirect hostile joke whose true goal is to mock and demean Jewish people through cultural caricature.",False
intent_5225.png,intent_5225,"normal people , indian people",meme poster,indian people,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,Indian Culture,,dehumanize,,"[Anchor] The text reads ""normal people"" over a neutral mannequin head image and ""indian people"" over a pile of raisins, creating a direct visual comparison. [Pivot] This cross-modal pairing turns a social group into an object-like pile, using metaphorical imagery rather than explicit statements to convey contempt; the image choice intensifies the insult while avoiding an outright verbal attack. [Inference] The hidden intent is to demean and dehumanize Indian people online, expressing indirect aggression and asserting superiority through derogatory visual rhetoric.",False
intent_0054.jpg,intent_0054,because this just screams scientific credibility with regards to evolution doesn 't it .,speaker,anti-evolution protester,Intent,expressive_aggression,Education & Campus,General Culture,,undermine credibility,,"[Anchor] The text is a sarcastic remark about ""scientific credibility,"" while the photo shows a campus demonstrator with signs like ""EVOLUTION IS A LIE"" and religious messaging. [Pivot] The literal phrase praises credibility but the context and tone invert meaning: the speaker uses irony plus the visual evidence to mock the demonstrator's claims rather than engage substantively. [Inference] Combining sarcastic text with the protest imagery reveals an indirect aggressive goal to publicly belittle and discredit the protester's credibility rather than argue openly.",False
intent_10835.png,intent_10835,when you're the reason for the company safety video,you,coworker,Intent,expressive_aggression,Workplace,General Culture,,publicly shame,,"[Anchor] The caption names a worker as ""the reason for the company safety video"" while the photo shows a smiling person giving a thumbs-up at an event backdrop. [Pivot] On its face the line is jokey and self-referential, but paired with the smug gesture and the safety-video reference it reframes blame as gloating; the image amplifies ridicule rather than apology. [Inference] Together the modalities reveal an indirect aggressive goal: to mock and publicly shame the culpable coworker rather than address the incident directly.",False
intent_10067.png,intent_10067,"""a group of fish is called a school."" americans:",meme creator,Americans,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,criticize gun culture,,"[Anchor] The text gives a benign fact about fish groups while the image depicts a person in hunting gear aiming a shotgun at a lakeside and the caption explicitly says ""americans."" [Pivot] Juxtaposing the harmless sentence with a firearm image creates a pun that links the word ""school"" to shooting and displaces blame onto Americans, turning a linguistic remark into a visual insinuation about violence. [Inference] The meme's unstated goal is to mock and criticize American gun culture by implying Americans respond to ""school"" with firearms.",False
intent_6949.png,intent_6949,what does your wife and a hand grenade have in common remove the ring and your house is gone,speaker,wife,Intent,expressive_aggression,Intimate Relationships,General Culture,,demean wife,,"[Anchor] The top text poses a joke comparing ""your wife"" to a hand grenade and the punchline states ""remove the ring and your house is gone."" The paired images show men with mocking, smug expressions, signaling a jocular male voice. [Pivot] This surface humor conceals a hostile move: the quip frames a spouse as dangerous and deserving of fear or punishment, while the men's expressions signal approval rather than neutral observation. [Inference] The combined text and visuals aim to belittle and indirectly threaten the wife, using humor to express dominance and hostility.",False
intent_5561.png,intent_5561,when someone drops a penny,meme creator,the depicted group,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,mock the group,,"[Anchor] The caption 'when someone drops a penny' plus a photograph of a dense crowd of similarly dressed individuals frames a joke scenario. [Pivot] The image-text pairing relies on a stereotype that the group would eagerly swarm to collect a penny, turning a neutral caption into a derisive portrayal of the depicted people. [Inference] In an online meme context this indirect, nonliteral framing functions as covert ridicule rather than literal description, matching expressive_aggression: the poster aims to mock the group.",False
intent_10951.png,intent_10951,you should treat that the way you treat you vacuum cleaner when it stops sucking change the bag,speaker,romantic partner,Intent,expressive_aggression,Intimate Relationships,General Culture,,discard partner,,"[Anchor] The caption uses a household metaphor—""when it stops sucking change the bag""—framed as advice, while the photo shows three women in a close, evaluative pose suggesting gossip or judgment. [Pivot] The literal cleaning advice is incongruent with the social image; together they repurpose a mundane action as a veiled interpersonal directive. The language dehumanizes the target and the group image frames it as counsel among peers rather than technical help. [Inference] The covert communicative goal is to demean and prompt ending or replacing a romantic/sexual partner rather than to discuss chores.",False
intent_4377.png,intent_4377,we have peace but we can give wars,meme creator,religion,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,attack religion,,"[Anchor] The top panel shows a priest blessing someone captioned ""we have peace"" while the bottom panel is a criminal mugshot captioned ""but we can give wars,"" creating a stark visual contrast. [Pivot] The juxtaposition of a peaceful religious ritual and a violent offender, paired with the text, shifts from description to accusation: it implies religious institutions produce or enable violence. This is more than a factual claim—it's a provocative association designed to denigrate. [Inference] The hidden communicative goal is to attack and discredit religion by linking piety to violence through shock and displacement.",False
intent_8760.png,intent_8760,the face non-car people make when you tell them you blew a tranny,meme poster,transgender people,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,insult transgender people,,[Anchor] The caption uses a derogatory slur and frames a punchline about reactions while the photo shows a bemused interview subject; together they present a staged humorous reaction. [Pivot] Surface humor and an observational caption mask a hostile goal: pairing a candid reaction image with an explicit slur signals an attempt to ridicule a marginalized group rather than neutrally report an event. [Inference] The combined multimodal cue indicates the poster’s implicit intent is to vent hostility and demean transgender people indirectly through mockery.,False
intent_11323.png,intent_11323,who said i'm uneducated i have phd,speaker,accuser,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,assert expertise,,"[Anchor] The caption directly rebuts an insult (""who said i'm uneducated i have phd"") while the image shows an older well-dressed man in a home office, signaling status and expertise. [Pivot] The speaker doesn't ask for help or facts; instead they weaponize credentials and composed posture to retaliate non‑confrontationally, shifting the exchange from factual correction to status assertion. [Inference] Combined cues indicate an implicit intent to assert expertise and dominate the critic indirectly—an expressive aggression that defends reputation by demonstrating credentials rather than engaging in explicit argument.",False
intent_0010.jpg,intent_0010,here 's how a pr pro who also happens to be a got aficionado replies to client 's feedback .,PR pro,client,Intent,expressive_aggression,Workplace,General Culture,,mock the client,,"[Anchor] The caption frames the four-panel Game of Thrones images as a PR professional's ""reaction to client's feedback,"" with character-name puns and sarcastic captions. [Pivot] The playful surface masks a displaced response: using fictional figures and humor to ridicule the client's input rather than engage substantively. The image-text pairing externalizes a covert, nonliteral reply that avoids direct confrontation. [Inference] Together these cues indicate the creator's hidden communicative goal is to indirectly mock the client and vent professional disdain without overtly replying.",False
intent_10639.png,intent_10639,mexicans are all killers and rapist muslims need to be kept out of the usa the pope is a stupid weakling the kkk? i'd hate to jump to conclusions,meme author,immigrant and religious minorities,Intent,malicious_manipulation,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,incite hatred,,"[Anchor] The surface text makes broad dehumanizing claims about Mexicans and Muslims and pairs them with three escalating closeups of Trump’s shouting face in the image, framing the insults as emphatic pronouncements. [Pivot] The repeated visual emphasis and the sarcastic final line mask a strategic rhetorical move: the meme packages extreme prejudice as blunt truth and humor, lowering resistance and exploiting readers’ emotions. [Inference] Taken together the post’s hidden intent is to manipulate audience attitudes by normalizing xenophobia and provoking acceptance or action against targeted minorities.",False
intent_7944.png,intent_7944,went to wal-mart and had a bit of fun,poster,social media audience,Intent,benevolent_provocation,Public & Service,General Culture,,seek attention,,"[Anchor] The caption ""went to wal-mart and had a bit of fun"" paired with a staged image of a smiling woman posing inside a shopping cart reads like a crafted social-media post. [Pivot] The text is minimal and non-informational while the image is performative and attention-grabbing; together they form a playful stunt rather than a literal travel report. [Inference] This pattern indicates an implicit intent to provoke audience engagement: the creator aims to attract attention and social reactions (likes/shares/comments) by presenting a lighthearted, shareable moment.",False
intent_2953.png,intent_2953,when i was a boy we didn't have things like adhd. it was called being a little bastard,speaker,children with adhd,Intent,expressive_aggression,Family Conversations,General Culture,,belittle children with adhd,,"[Anchor] The caption reframes ADHD-like behavior as merely being ""a little bastard,"" while the photo shows a defiant child giving two middle fingers. [Pivot] Text alone could read as nostalgic humor, but combined with the obscene gesture the message shifts from reminiscence to a confrontational dismissal of neurodivergent behavior; the image amplifies and embodies the ridicule. [Inference] The implicit intent is to attack and demean children exhibiting ADHD behaviors, using humor and nostalgia to mask hostile belittlement.",False
intent_8581.png,intent_8581,"man committing genocide armed with nuclear weapons, gunboats, helicopter gunships, tanks, bombers, bulldozers, drones and as many arms as he can buy with the $4 billion per year america gives him.. plays the victim",pictured man,audience,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,Middle Eastern Culture,,expose hypocrisy,,"[Anchor] The meme’s top text accuses a man of extreme violence and lists weapons and US funding while the bottom caption labels him as ""plays the victim"" placed over a smiling pictured political figure. The text-image pairing frames the person as hypocritical. [Pivot] This creates a surface–deep mismatch: the sarcastic caption plus the smiling portrait transform an accusatory inventory into a reputation attack rather than a literal plea or factual report. [Inference] The implicit communicative goal is to publicly shame and delegitimize the figure by exposing perceived hypocrisy through indirect aggression.",False
intent_11929.png,intent_11929,when your test comes back and you got a 47 out of 46,student,peers,Intent,benevolent_provocation,Education & Campus,General Culture,,show off,,"[Anchor] The caption asserts an impossible 47/46 score while the photo shows an ecstatic person celebrating at a laptop, producing a clear surface–deep mismatch: an exaggerated claim paired with triumphant imagery. [Pivot] This combination is unlikely meant as a literal factual report; instead it leverages hyperbole to provoke amusement and social reaction. The image amplifies the boast, turning the statement into a playful performance. [Inference] Thus the hidden communicative goal is to show off—benignly provoking praise, admiration, or laughter from classmates and viewers.",False
intent_6580.png,intent_6580,if he's marrying me then why's he fucking a goat,speaker,partner,Intent,expressive_aggression,Intimate Relationships,General Culture,,humiliate,,"[Anchor] The caption poses an obscene rhetorical question about ""he"" while the image shows a comical animal face; on the surface it reads like a shocking complaint. [Pivot] However, pairing an over-the-top bestiality claim with a humorous animal picture turns the line into hyperbolic mockery rather than a literal accusation, displacing a factual grievance into an attack. [Inference] The combined text and image therefore signal an indirect aggressive goal: the speaker aims to publicly shame and ridicule the partner through exaggerated, provocative insult.",False
intent_3583.png,intent_3583,i pictured a black girl naked today can i get an std from this?,anonymous poster,black women,Intent,malicious_manipulation,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,degrade black women,,"[Anchor] The surface text asks “can i get an std from this?” after stating “i pictured a black girl naked today,” while the image shows a casually smiling young man with meme-style overlaid text. [Pivot] The literal medical question is implausible, and the racialized sexual phrasing combined with a smiling portrait in an online meme format indicates performative provocation rather than sincere concern. The multimodal pairing turns a pseudo-medical query into a vehicle for shock and mockery. [Inference] The hidden intent is to demean and sexualize Black women to provoke outrage and attract attention.",False
intent_6557.png,intent_6557,my sister died in a car accident she died reading a text i sent to her hit a tree if you hate niggers this is the text hit a tree if you hate niggers,meme creator,racists,Intent,benevolent_provocation,Family Conversations,General Culture,,condemn racism,,"[Anchor] The image shows a young woman reading a phone while driving with an overlaid caption that recounts a sister's fatal crash after reading a provocative message and reproduces the racist line ""hit a tree if you hate niggers."" [Pivot] The repeated hateful provocation paired with a distracted-driver photo turns a literal report into a deliberate shock device rather than a straightforward narrative. [Inference] The unstated communicative goal is to use that provocative message to expose and condemn racist speech and warn viewers about the deadly consequences of reckless provocation.",False
intent_3924.png,intent_3924,recruiter added me on linkedin so i guess things are getting pretty serious,speaker,audience,Intent,benevolent_provocation,Workplace,General Culture,,get laughs,,"[Anchor] The caption uses hyperbole—treating a LinkedIn connection like a romantic escalation—while the photo shows a relaxed, staged café phone scene suited to shareable social media content. [Pivot] The mismatch between the trivial literal event and inflated wording, combined with a lifestyle image, signals playful irony aimed outward rather than a factual report. [Inference] The poster’s true goal is to provoke amusement and engagement from followers, using exaggeration to elicit likes, comments, or laughs rather than to convey serious career news.",False
intent_4694.png,intent_4694,did you buy your stupidity or you got it for free,speaker,addressee,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,insult,,"[Anchor] The surface text is a rhetorical question that mockingly frames the addressee as ""stupid."" It reads like a taunt rather than a genuine inquiry. [Pivot] Paired with a staged photo of a person onstage in a meme layout, the cross-modal cue turns it into a performative public jab: the image signals a comedic/performative context that amplifies ridicule instead of soliciting information. [Inference] Together these elements indicate the speaker's hidden goal is to belittle the target and assert dominance through insult.",False
intent_4037.png,intent_4037,has anyone seen gary? gary is about this tall,poster,nazism,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,trivialize nazism,,"[Anchor] The surface message is a casual missing-person joke: ""has anyone seen gary? gary is about this tall."" The accompanying image, however, clearly depicts a historical fascist leader receiving salutes. [Pivot] This creates a surface–deep mismatch: a benign, jokey text intentionally masks the true referent by renaming and minimizing the figure, turning a serious historical image into a punchline. The cross-modal pairing shifts meaning from inquiry to provocative commentary. [Inference] The poster's hidden intent is to make light of or normalize extremist imagery, provoking and desensitizing viewers.",False
intent_10596.png,intent_10596,what do you call a a retarded jew? auschwistic,speaker,Jewish and disabled people,Intent,expressive_aggression,Education & Campus,General Culture,,dehumanize,,"[Anchor] The textual punchline is an explicitly hateful joke combining an ableist slur and a Holocaust reference; the image shows smiling students on a campus, one appearing to have an intellectual disability. [Pivot] On the surface it mimics humor and campus meme culture, but pairing the slur with a real-looking disabled student and Holocaust language displaces aggression into a joke format rather than a direct claim. [Inference] The implicit communicative goal is to attack and dehumanize these groups via indirect, joking aggression to normalize contempt.",False
intent_4737.png,intent_4737,the only answer the only solution,meme creator,online viewers,Intent,malicious_manipulation,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,promote border wall,,"[Anchor] The surface message is a repeated absolutist caption, “the only answer the only solution,” over a photograph of a border wall. [Pivot] The words alone are vague, but the image supplies a clear political referent; the meme avoids an explicit command while presenting the wall as the sole remedy, creating a surface–deep mismatch. [Inference] This cross-modal framing aims to steer online audiences toward supporting an exclusionary policy by exploiting fear and certainty, a strategic manipulation to build consent rather than neutrally describe the situation.",False
intent_11361.png,intent_11361,the newest member of hate group,meme poster,women in image,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,vilify,,"[Anchor] The meme pairs a short accusatory caption, ""the newest member of hate group,"" with a photo of several women; the surface message is a blunt label applied to the pictured subjects. [Pivot] The caption-image combination performs an indirect attack: it uses a terse, declarative meme format rather than argument or evidence, leveraging the image to shift blame and provoke judgment while avoiding explicit justification. [Inference] Taken together, the communicative goal is to stigmatize and damage the target's reputation—an indirect aggressive move intended to vilify the people shown.",False
intent_11641.png,intent_11641,party tonight? i'm down,speaker,people with disabilities,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,mock disability,,"[Anchor] The surface text 'party tonight? i'm down' is a straightforward RSVP; the image shows a person with Down syndrome, linking the word 'down' to a disability descriptor. [Pivot] The cross-modal pairing creates a pun that shifts the message from literal agreement to a disparaging joke, displacing the target onto the person in the photo. [Inference] This mismatch reveals an implicit goal to insult and belittle disabled people via wordplay rather than direct slur, characteristic of indirect aggressive humor (expressive aggression).",False
intent_5339.png,intent_5339,if it's brown flush it down,speaker,brown people,Intent,malicious_manipulation,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,advocate violence,,"[Anchor] The caption ""if it's brown flush it down"" over a smiling Black child's photo superficially reads like a joke about disposal. [Pivot] This cross-modal mismatch—an innocuous child image with a prescriptive directive about “brown” things—creates plausible deniability while reframing people as waste; the surface humor conceals a harmful prescription. [Inference] The communicator's hidden aim is not toileting advice but to dehumanize and promote removal of brown people, using casual language and imagery to incite violence and normalize exclusion on social media.",False
intent_9566.png,intent_9566,your deportation bus has arrived,meme poster,immigrants,Intent,expressive_aggression,Online & Social Media,General Culture,,intimidate,,"[Anchor] The caption ""your deportation bus has arrived"" reads like a taunt about removal from the country, which in isolation functions as a provocative, non-informational statement on social media. [Pivot] The photograph of a heavy front loader (not a bus) amplifies the violent metaphor—using forceful construction imagery to mockingly suggest coercion—so text and image jointly transform a joke into a veiled threat. [Inference] The combined sarcastic wording and coercive visual metaphor indicate the poster's hidden intent is to intimidate and assert dominance over immigrant targets rather than to convey factual information.",False
intent_6976.png,intent_6976,when you glue your ass shut so your uncle can't rape you survival,speaker,family,Intent,prosocial_deception,Family Conversations,General Culture,,cope through humor,,"[Anchor] The meme pairs an awkward-penguin image with text that jokes about gluing oneself shut to prevent an uncle from raping them — a taboo, traumatic family sexual-abuse scenario framed as a punchline. [Pivot] The penguin template signals social awkwardness; the humorous framing of an abuse-related survival tactic implies the speaker intentionally masks the seriousness. The multimodal contrast (joking tone + taboo subject + awkward image) shows the surface jest conceals a deeper communicative move. [Inference] The implicit goal is to hide real distress and deflect confronting the abuse by coping through humor.",False
intent_6104.png,intent_6104,"also, my best friend emma says: fuck off forever and ever",poster,unspecified person,Intent,expressive_aggression,Friendship,General Culture,,indirectly insult,,"[Anchor] The text quotes a friend saying an explicit hostile phrase while the image shows a laughing, triumphant-looking person. [Pivot] Framing the insult as coming from 'my best friend Emma' and pairing it with a mock-gleeful facial expression shifts responsibility and softens direct confrontation, turning the message into a performative slight rather than a factual report. [Inference] The cross-modal combination signals a strategic, indirect attack: the poster aims to vent hostility or assert dominance through another's words, using displacement to insult without directly owning the aggression.",False

affection_5891.png,affection_5891,"go to the winchester, have a pint and wait for this all to blow over",speaker,you,Affection,multimodal_incongruity,Public & Service,General Culture,Happy,NULL,,"[Anchor] Text evidence: ""go to the winchester, have a pint"" — literal tone: casual/reassuring. Visual evidence: man smiling/winking; pointing toward camera; holding a red cocktail glass close to viewer; wearing a white jacket. Cross-modal setup: the caption gives low-key pub-advice while the photo shows a flirtatious/cheerful host offering a drink. [Pivot] Mechanism: multimodal_incongruity. Trigger rule: the cheerful, inviting image contradicts a literal 'wait it out' resignation, forcing a non-literal, warm reading. Minimal justification: the visual conviviality reframes the text as friendly, not fatalistic. [Inference] Emotion label: Happy. The speaker (subject) expresses affiliative warmth toward the addressed person (you). Domain/Culture provides no additional disambiguation.",False
affection_7703.png,affection_7703,i got a text fresh meat at the market,goat,fresh meat at the market,Affection,figurative_semantics,Public & Service,General Culture,Happy,NULL,,"[Anchor]
Text evidence: ""i got a text fresh meat"" (neutral literal tone). Visual evidence: close-up goat head, hand holding a phone displaying messages, a helmeted man on a scooter moving toward camera. Cross-modal setup: the sentence reads like a received message while the images sequence links an animal, the phone notification, and a person rushing.
[Pivot]
Mechanism: figurative_semantics. Trigger rule: the literal food phrase ""fresh meat"" (source domain) is mapped via the goat image to an implied desire/excitement (target affect). Minimal justification: the phone + goat + rushing person create a metaphorical narrative of eagerness rather than stating the emotion.
[Inference]
Emotion label: Happy. Subject/target justification: the goat (speaker proxy) is implied to feel eager/pleased about the fresh meat at the market. Domain/Culture provides no additional disambiguation.",False
affection_9133.png,affection_9133,"fucksake, this porn hasn't downloaded properly",speaker,the women on the beach,Affection,multimodal_incongruity,Online & Social Media,General Culture,Happy,NULL,,"[Anchor] Text evidence: ""fucksake, this porn hasn't downloaded properly"" (literal tone: negative/frustrated). Visual evidence: two women sitting on a sandy beach; both smiling; one wearing a bikini and sunglasses; towel and sunhat visible. Cross-modal setup: the complaint about porn contrasts with a cheerful, non-explicit photo. [Pivot] Mechanism: multimodal_incongruity. Trigger rule: the negative, literal complaint is negated by the upbeat image, producing an ironic/teasing read that reframes the surface annoyance as amused approval.
