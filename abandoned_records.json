      "rationale": "[Anchor] The caption explicitly notes the husband complies only after being asked while the photo shows a distressed, tearful woman—a plaintive personal complaint framed as a meme. [Pivot] That cross-modal pairing creates a surface–deep mismatch: rather than neutrally reporting, the public, emotional presentation functions as an indirect reproach aimed beyond literal content. [Inference] The speaker’s likely hidden goal is to vent and indirectly coerce change by provoking guilt or social shame in the husband rather than confronting him directly."

Visual evidence: man smiling broadly; head tilted back; both index fingers pointed upward; wearing a casual hoodie. Cross-modal setup: the caption makes a crude claim while the photo shows a joyful, self-referential pose. [Pivot] Mechanism: multimodal_incongruity. Trigger rule: the upbeat, proud image cancels a literal offense reading and reframes the caption as teasing humor. Minimal justification: the modalities contradict, forcing a non-literal, playful interpretation. [Inference] Emotion label: Happy. Subject/target justification: the man in the photo appears amused (subject) about the stated act/‘his cat’ (target). Domain/Culture usage: Online & Social Media/General Culture meme conventions signal joking/teasing, supporting a playful affectionate read."
